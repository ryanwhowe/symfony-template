# symfony-template
This is a template for a docker based development of a symfony based application with nginx and mysql support

## Templates
There are two issue templates for GitHub included in the repo.  These can prompt the reporters to generate good issues.
In addition, there is a Pull Request Template to help keep the communication focus on the PR to help create quality pull
requests.

### Bug Report
Bug reports that stress reproduction steps, expected behavior and screenshots

### Feature Request
Feature requests that keep the focus on the problem that needs to be resolved over how the reported feels it should be
solved with prompts for additional information

Please update this README file to suit the needs of your project, I only ask that you please reference the template project if you base a solution off it.  If possible please keep below this line when you use this template for your project
